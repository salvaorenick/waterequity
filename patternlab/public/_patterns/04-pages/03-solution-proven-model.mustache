            <p>WaterCredit leverages philanthropy to allow people to tap into their potential as customers. For example, it provides subsidies and technical assistance to microfinance institutions to help them launch loan portfolios. The loans enable the world’s poor to pay for a connection to a water source or install a toilet in their homes.</p>

            <p>WaterCredit accelerates progress toward ending the global water crisis. But for this initiative to reach its full potential, we need to unlock more, affordable social investment capital to help microfinance institutions and other enterprises scale their water and sanitation efforts to meet market demand.</p>
            <h3 class="brand-dark-blue">WaterCredit Investment Fund 1 (WCIF1) is one step in this direction.</h3>
            <p>
                This pilot fund launched in 2014 to provide dedicated loan capital at a slightly lower cost to seven of Water.org’s highest performing microfinance institutions in India, helping them scale their water and sanitation lending portfolios.
            </p>
            <p>
                The loans from the $11 million fund are projected to reach at least 730,000 people, while providing a targeted two percent return to the fund investors.
